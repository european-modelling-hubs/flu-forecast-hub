team_model_designation: primary
methods: An inverse-WIS weighted ensemble of 3 component models - an exponential trend smoothing (ETS)  model, a quantile AR model, and a baseline model of random walk with drift. 
license: CC-BY_SA-4.0
data_inputs: ECDC ERVISS
methods_long: Quantile autoregression model uses quantgen R package, and is similar to CMU-Timeseries model from 2022/23 FluSight season. Random walk and ETS models use fable R package. To build an ensemble, the quantile distributions of the component models are weighted (location- and target-specific) by the mean of inverse-WIS scores over the last 3 weeks that could be evaluated. The estimates are solely the responsibility of the contributors and do not represent, nor are endorsed by, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
