methods: "A Bayesian piece-wise square-root-linear model fit."
methods_long: "Model consists of 1) scaling of the data (convert to square-root-scale), 2) assigning data points into groups such that neighbouring data points belong to the same group, and simultaneously in Stan 3) fitting piece-wise intercept-slope models in each group, 4) regularizing the difference between neighbouring slopes to be close to 0, 5) generating a future slope based on the last slope plus fitted noise."
