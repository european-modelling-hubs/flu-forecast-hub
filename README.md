# hubTemplate

**This repository is in development.**

This repository serves as a template for groups wishing to build and maintain a new modeling hub, in the style of the [US COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub), the [US Scenario Modeling Hub](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub) or the [European COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe). Researchers from these teams have created the Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs to provide a [recommended set of standards and documentation](https://hubdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for building and maintaining collaborative modeling hubs.

This repository may be cloned to start a new repository for a modeling hub.
